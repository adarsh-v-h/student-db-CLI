## Introduction
This is a simple student database managing CLI project. It is great to understand how we can use python to run SQL comamnds. The library here used is SQLite3, which is considered the lightest SQL framework, ofcource being light meanse less features, but it does run on **90%** of the webservers.

## Getting Started
Follow the below steps: <br>
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adarsh-v-h/student-db-CLI.git
cd student-db-CLT
pip install -r requrements.txt
cd main
python creating.py
python main.py
```
Here the creating.py, is to create the database and the table, run it before trying to add data to the table  .

## TECH Stack
Python • SQL • SQLite3

## Before you go
I have made this thing as a project to get good at backend, and how Python can be used to interact with database, instead of running commands everytime. This is one of most clean and simple uses of python as a Scripting language.<br>
You can use this project, suggest me any updates, and also if you have any idea I am open to collaborate.
